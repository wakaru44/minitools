minitools
=========

minitools is a package of little tools that i make. They have no relationship between them.

By now, i have things like:

voice-recognition > a few scripts to help creating corpus and models for your voice recognition software

monete > a small script to diff files ;)

instalar_colores_vim > a small script to install pathogen (vim plugins manager) and solarized colors on VIM
