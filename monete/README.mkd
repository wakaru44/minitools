# Monete - Monitorig Tool

## What's this shit nigga?

"Nagios is a chainsaw. This is a scalpel"

Monete is a little script, that you can configure in your crontab.

You configure it to run every X minutes, or when you want.
It will _execute_ the configured command, _compare the output_ to the output obtained in the "right" execution, _and send an email_ if they are different.

This means, that you can **monitor any change in your system**.


## Usage

	1.- Put it in a dir 
		like /usr/bin or /etc/cron.d
	2.- Choose a working dir
		like /usr/local/monete
	3.- Configure your crontab
		like to execute every five minutes
	5.- Configure your options in monete.sh
		You should change the EMAILADDRESS and the WORK_DIR
	6.- Configure your command to launch
		like "monitors/process.sh apache"
	7.- Save a base file, so we can check against it
		like "monete-command-base.log"
	8.- Your good to go

## Monitors

We, have also created a few helping scripts called "monitors" that will help you use Monete with ease, and get ready in a minute.

If you need more documentation about a "monitor", check the file of it. Usually you call them with some param, and they handle the output.
